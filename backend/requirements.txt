# Saleor dependencies (Saleor itself is installed from GitHub during build)
# IMPORTANT: Saleor must be installed FIRST (before this file)
# Saleor will install compatible versions of graphene, graphql-relay, etc.
# This file only contains additional dependencies not provided by Saleor
# IMPORTANT:
# Do NOT pin Django here. Saleor (installed from GitHub during build) defines the compatible
# Django version range. Pinning Django here can force incompatible GraphQL stack versions.

# GraphQL
# Runtime evidence (Railway ping) showed: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'graphene_django'
# Our extensions use graphene_django.DjangoObjectType and our URLConf may fall back to graphene_django.views.GraphQLView.
# Saleor install does not guarantee graphene-django is present, so we must include it here.
# Runtime evidence (Railway boot) showed Saleor imports:
#   from graphql.execution import executor
#   from ..error import GraphQLError, GraphQLLocatedError
# This is the graphql-core 2.x API. Therefore pin the GraphQL stack to 2.x-compatible versions.
