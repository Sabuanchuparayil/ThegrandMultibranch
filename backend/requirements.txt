# Saleor dependencies (Saleor itself is installed from GitHub during build)
# IMPORTANT: Saleor must be installed FIRST (before this file)
# Saleor will install compatible versions of graphene, graphql-relay, etc.
# This file only contains additional dependencies not provided by Saleor
# IMPORTANT:
# Do NOT pin Django here. Saleor (installed from GitHub during build) defines the compatible
# Django version range. Pinning Django here can force incompatible GraphQL stack versions.

# IMPORTANT: Do NOT install graphene-django.
# Runtime evidence: graphene-django 2.x crashes on Django 5 (ImportError: force_text).
# We removed all graphene_django usage from our extensions and rely on Saleor's GraphQL stack.
# We keep these pins aligned with Saleor 3.23.x (graphene 2 / graphql-core 2).
